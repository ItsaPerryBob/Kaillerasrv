Rights from the coder at kaillera.com, only researching this project.

To use kaillerasrv u need to do these commands in Ubuntu:
sudo add-apt-repository universe
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get install libncurses5 libstdc++6 zlib1g

before
Type in "ls" (no quotes) and hit enter. Hopefully you're going to see kaillerasrv.tar.gz. If so, go to the next step. If not, try and download it again. (Alternatively, you can download it to your local computer, then use an ftp program to transfer it to your shell.)

Type "tar -zxf kaillerasrv.tar.gz" and hit enter. You should now have a few more files in your home directory.

Next, type "chmod +x kaillerasrv" and hit enter.

Finally, type "./kaillerasrv" and hit enter. You'll see some stuff about touching the master server and so on. Congrats! Your server is working.
